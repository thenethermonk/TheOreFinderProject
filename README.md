Combine them to create the Overworld and Universal Goggles, which grant you night vision for exploring those deep, shadowy caves. Embark on a thrilling journey of discovery and let the Ore Finder Project illuminate your way to untold wealth!

1.0.4 Update
---
- Added a new options window that you can access while holding a pair of goggles in your main hand and using the item while crouched or sneaking. (PC - Shift Right Click)
  - New Option - Effect: This allows you to turn change the effect applied while wearing the goggles on your head. For all googles you can choose between None and Torch. Overworld and Universal can also choose Night Vision.
  - New Option - Double Distance: Turning this on will allow you to see twice as far away. This can be very helpfull for rare blocks like Ancient Debris and Emerald Ore. (WARNING!!! Have double distance on with Overworld or Universal goggles can cause lag due to the number of entities it creates. Use with caution!!!)
- Added the ability for the goggles to also be held in the off hand. This will allow you to technically look for 3 different blocks (head, off hand, & main hand) before you get your Overworld goggles. Oh, did I forget to mention these stack???
- Added a bit of lore to the goggles when you hover over them in your inventory after changing the options. This way you don't have to open the options menu to see what you have set.

Future Update
- The next update will be adding an options on overworld and universal goggles to turn on/off individual blocks. For example: Later in the game you probably won't care about looking for Iron or Copper, so you will be able to turn those off.

Not only do these goggles highlight ores, but they also light up your surroundings when you wear them. The Overworld and Universal Goggles even give you night vision while you're wearing them. Remember, you have to wear the goggles to get the light and night vision effects â€“ just holding them will only highlight ores.
