The Ore Finder Project
===

Unleash your inner miner with The Ore Finder Project, a groundbreaking addon for Minecraft Bedrock that revolutionizes your mining escapades. Craft stunning goggles that allow you to effortlessly detect valuable ores like coal, copper, gold, iron, and diamonds hidden beneath layers of blocks, giving you a significant advantage in your quest for riches.

These remarkable goggles not only unveil the treasures lurking nearby but also light up your path, ensuring you never overlook a precious find in the darkness. Combine them to create the Overworld and Universal Goggles, which grant you night vision for exploring those deep, shadowy caves. Embark on a thrilling journey of discovery and let the Ore Finder Project illuminate your way to untold wealth!

Features
---
- Each set of goggles can be held in the main hand, the off hand or used as a helmet. This allows you to stack 3 different goggles at one time!
- When used as a helmet, the single block goggles act as a light source. While the Overworld and Universal goggles grant night vision.
- If you USE a pair of goggles while sneaking/crouching you will open up an options menu for those googles. Options include...
  - Changing the lighting effect granted by the googles: None, Torch, or Night Vision (Where allowed)
  - Turn on/off Double Distance, which will allow you to see twice as far away. This can be very helpfull for rare blocks like Ancient Debris and Emerald Ore. (WARNING!!! Have double distance on with Overworld or Universal goggles can cause lag due to the number of entities it creates. Use with caution!!!)
  - Changing the type of entity that marks the location of the ores (Box, Orb, Outline, Ore)

Future (Possible) Updates
---
- Adding an option on overworld and universal goggles to turn on/off individual blocks. For example: Later in the game you probably won't care about looking for Iron or Copper, so you will be able to turn those off.
- Collaborating with some of the ORE addons to make new goggles for their custom ores
